Leslie: Welcome everyone to
our webinar series

"Where Do I Start? The
Basics of Converting

instructor-led Training (or ILT) to Virtual
instructor-led

Training (or the VILT)"
and this webinar series is

presented by the National Institute
of Corrections

in collaboration with
the International

Association of Correctional
Training Personnel

or IACTP I'm Leslie
LeMaster with NIC

and I'll be serving
today as your WebEx

host and one of your
facilitators for webinar three,

which is the final
in this series.

You will notice as
you join, that this is a listen-

only webinar and the
voices that you're

going to be hearing will
be mine, as your host,

and those, as your facilitators.
Your way of communicating with us

is via the chat
function, which is

located in the lower right
hand corner of the WebEx

webinar screen. So, to ensure that
chat function is turned on for you,

please look in the
lower right-

hand corner of your
screen and locate an icon,

which looks like a text
box or a chat bubble.

Just click that icon to turn on
chat and the chat box will open

in the lower right-hand
corner of your screen.

We know a lot of you have already
been chatting already, but we

encourage you to try
that chat out and

at least say hello or
give us a weather report

and where you're joining us from
because this is going to be

your way to ask questions make
comments and share resources all

along the way during
today's webinar.

Just to let you know, this
webinar is being recorded

and when the recording is
available and any resources

also available, we
will let you know

via email from me when that recording
and resources are available

on the NIC website. In fact,
if you've registered for

any of the webinars in this
series, you will get that email.

So, just to let you know,
there will be a

question and answer
session, but we also

encourage you to ask
questions in chat

to everyone all along the
way and we will answer

as many as we can either in the
moment when we see the question

or during our question
and answer period

as we move towards the
end of today's webinar.

So, our producers, just to pull back
the curtain in the background,

will be monitoring
chat for any of your

technical issues
you might be

experiencing during
the webinar delivery

and they'll also be
posting resources.

Also, they're going to be
monitoring for your questions

and just to give you a
little trainer tip for VILT,

they'll be actually
sending those to me in

private chat so that
when we get to the

Q&A period. I will be
ready to moderate

that I'll have them
all waiting for me

to scroll through and find.
So, without further ado,

let's get started
with today's webinar.

So, today is the final
webinar in our three

webinar series and we
will focus in on using

ADDIE as our road map again, as we
did in the first two webinars

and use it for designing
and adding interaction

and engagement
tools to achieve collaboration

in virtual training.

And before we
get started today, I would love

for each member of
our facilitator team

to introduce themselves.
Jeff, you're up first.

Jeff: Well, good morning
everyone and welcome

back. We're excited to be
finishing up this webinar series

and it couldn't be
more timely for us at

NIC and it this is a great
reminder for us as well as we

are currently in the
process of converting

several pieces of our
curriculum, as well.

I know the academy
division has about

two or three more that
we're fixing to start on

and putting the
pipeline to convert one

of those being the learning
professional, which was

traditionally 100 percent
instructor-led and

we're going to make
that virtual

instructor-led with
a virtual T4C

component so this is
timely for us. It's

a great reminder. And so,
we're excited today to

share with you and also learn
from you along the way

on virtual conversion..
So, thank you and

look forward to it.

Leslie: Thank you, Jeff.
And, Jim.

Jim: Hey. Good morning everyone.
excited to be back

with you folks. As I look through
the list of participants,

a lot of familiar names
there. A lot of great

trainers that I've
trained with in the past,

you know? So, I'm here on behalf of
the International

Association of Correctional
Training Personnel.

So, very proud to
partner with NIC on

this and, as Jeff
just mentioned,

what a timely
thing for us to be

doing right now. I'm
also working with NIC

helping to deliver
the correctional

leadership development
and management

development for the future programs
and we're doing

those virtually and learning
as we go, as well. So,

hopefully, as we go
along today, we can

share some of
those tips with you

folks and as
Jeff said learn from

you folks, as well.
So, excited to

share tips on engagement
interaction with you folks, today.

Leslie: Thank you, Jim. And, Ashley.

Ashley: Well, good morning, everyone.
Just mainly with all of

you that have been submersed
in this pandemic

and having to adjust and
adapt and overcome.

I've been living with
this for the last 11 months

as a front line staff
helping run an academy

that we had to adjust to VILT.
So, it's just been a journey

adapting and overcoming,
correcting things as we go

building upon what
we learn and I look

forward to sharing
that with you all

and getting some ideas
from you, as well. So,

hopefully, everyone enjoys. Thank
you.

Leslie: All right. Thank you, Ashley. And,
Ashley won't toot her

own horn, but I will for her.
Ashley was IACTP's and still

is IACTP's Trainer of the Year. So,
just wanted to let you know

we've got a award-winning
trainer right here with us.

So, we also have some other facilitators
to share with you. Beth!

Beth: Well, good morning.
Thank you, Leslie.

My name is Beth Kreger
and I work for

the Ohio Department
of Education.

I oversee our adult options
programs here in Ohio,

recently transitioned
into this role from

corrections. I spent about 26
years working in corrections

and actually was one of the
leads on the transition

for the new employee
orientation program

at the corrections
training academy in Ohio

from an instructor-led training
to a virtual instructor-led

training. And, as Leslie
said, you know, Ashley

was the trainer of the year and
Ashley played a very vital role

in that transition and I know
Ashley shared her story,

the Ohio story and I look
forward to certainly --

I think a lot of times during
these sessions, as Jim alluded to,

we can really learn
just as much from

you as hopefully you're
learning from us

and learning from
other folks. So,

I look forward to
being with you here

today and I hope that everyone
has a great

rest of the week.

Leslie: And thank you,
Beth. And, Archie!

Archie: Hello, everyone. I'm
Archie Weatherspoon IV

with the National
Institute of Corrections.

I am the Program Manager
for the Thinking For

A Change curriculum, so,
maybe some of you

are familiar with
that curriculum.

I'm really excited to
be here today. This

conversation that
we're having is near

and dear to my heart. I had the
luxury and the honor to kind of take

during this pandemic a program
that was already converted

into what to a blended
learning. So, with the VILT

and ILT component, but then
really change that ILT

component where we held on saying
these are the things that this

absolutely cannot be done unless
it's face to face. And guess what?

We were able to do
it all virtually. So,

I'm really excited to be here
today to share that with you all

and kind of how we find those
inner engagement interactions

with your
participants and your

students. So, thank you
for being here today

and let's have some fun.

Leslie: All right. Thank you, Archie,
and I'm Leslie LeMaster

with NIC I'm a correctional
program specialist

and when we're in the office
Archie's office is right next

door to me so I'm
really missing him and

I'm missing Jeff also because he's
typically right down the hall.

So today, I am functioning as
the WebEx host and I'm the

administrator of NIC's WebEx
site that we use for all

different things, but this also is
very near and dear to my heart

type of a webinar
series because

actually even before the
pandemic hit, I was working

on converting multiple instructor-led
leadership and first-line

supervisors trainings to virtual
instructor-led just so we'd

have a wider reach. So,
this is very timely.

This is a big part
of I know what I do

here. And we're so happy that
you're all here with us

to share not only
the lessons of our

experiences, meaning
your facilitator team,

but we want to hear some of the
lessons of your experiences

also by sharing
resources in chat.

So, let's
get started.

So, here are our two objectives for
today. Again, we're going to

be as interactive as we can
be on this webinar

platform. If we were in a virtual
instructor-led training platform,

we could do even more, but
this is a one-way audio

and chat is going
to be our main tool.

We're also going
to be doing some

on-screen annotation today, at
least we, the facilitators, are

to model how you can
even be interactive and

engaging in a
webinar format. So,

by the end of
this session, what we

hope you will be able to do
is to choose participant

interaction and engagement
tools to achieve collaboration

in your virtual training.
So, we're talking about

training design here based upon
your performance objectives

and describe initial
steps to design

interaction and engagement
tools to achieve collaboration

into your virtual instructor-led
training.

So, to start off today, we're
going to summarize, briefly, where

we've been so far in this ADDIE
conversion road trip.

In webinar one, back in December, we started
here looking at the big

picture of ILT to VILT conversion
by looking at different levels and

different lenses on analysis
always beginning with the end

in mind. And then, we took a
look at design exactly

what are you going
to be blending in

terms of your outcomes
and what about

the platform that your agency has
selected. Is it going to have

all the functionality that you
really need and want it to have?

Then, we took a look at
development considerations,

like the actual time
it takes to convert

from instructor-led to
virtual instructor-led

per hour. And also,
training trainers

and learners in the
use and effective

use of the virtual platform
that your agency has.

And then, in terms of implementation,
what about delivery time frames?

Coaching? Rehearsals?
All kinds of things

to make sure that when
you do fully implement.

It is going to be effective
and last, but not

least, and we don't want to
leave this out is evaluation.

Evaluation strategies
designed and implemented

on this conversion,
how are you going to

deploy them and
your process to

implement your evaluation
results back into this

ADDIE road trip as you
start your next road trip.

Then in webinar two, we took a look
at the basics of converting

ILT to VILT. What is
the status

at analysis phase of your
instructor-led curriculum?

Do you have a fully
hand-off curriculum with

lesson plans and
facilitator guides?

Participant workbooks
or participant guides?

Performance objectives written
at the application level?

Do you have posters, slide decks,
a full curriculum package

at design? We took a look at the
importance of converting your

performance objectives
from instructor-led

performance objectives to virtual
instructor-led performance

objectives. Then we moved
on to development. What

type of digital blend ingredients
are needed? And that was that

whole idea of things that you
would do online during your live

virtual instructor-led training
sessions and the digital blend

with virtual offline
activities, but then you

interconnect into your
live online sessions.

In other words,
blended learning, but

virtual blended
learning in all facets.

And then what about in
terms of implementation?

The live session durations and
scheduling? And also the deliberate

and strategic scheduling
of intersession periods?

And, again, last but not
least, evaluations.

Evaluation strategies
developed and

deployed and when
are you doing them,

both during and post
the VILT series?

So, that's where we've
been so far. Today,

we are going to
be focusing on...

How do I do this? How do I design
and add interaction and engagement

to achieve collaboration in
virtual instructor-led training?

Well, it's always good to
begin with end in mind.

So, as we've seen all
the way through

this, as we've started
going down

through the layers,
the ADDIE framework

applies to this, as well. And we cannot
tell you how important that analysis

stays in is to actually
making this work, in terms of

technological readiness,
learner readiness,

agency leadership commitment
and readiness to support it

fully and don't
forget to evaluate. We

just have a tendency to spend all
of our time in design, development

and implementation, but those other
two facets are extremely critical.

So, we begin with ADDIE just
as we have in webinars

one and two. And, first,
we're going to take

one more look at analyzing
what our agency

virtual platform
.can support

Jeff: Well, we're going to perform
analysis as the first

step of our road trip while
we explore designing

in and adding participant
interactions and engagements

to achieve collaboration
in our virtual training.

Beth: And, the first step is to analyze
what engagement or interaction and

collaboration tools that we need
to use and how can we transition

from our instructor-led training
transition those same tools

over to virtual
instructor-led training.

And once we do that, we can begin
actively designing

our curriculum.

So, during webinar one, we looked
at a variety of

virtual tools that you can use when designing
your virtual training

session and those are listed on the
screen right now.

Jeff: Take a look at these tools and
think about what your

agency actually supports...

and  this will help you decide
what tools that you can help design

into your program so as
you look at those

little bubbles there with the
chat and the various

other things in there, what
can you do in your agency?

what can you challenge the
process? The typical

norm to maybe get
some more of those things approved

as we move virtually?

And Leslie's using our pointer
and showing you some

of those. So, just think about as
you are designing this, what

can you do what can you not do
and what might you be able to

do if you challenge
the process?

Beth: So, in webinar two, we
talked about the importance

of having a complete instructor-led
curriculum available to

you as you to help you transition
into the virtual instructor-led training.

If you don't have that good
foundation to build upon,

you're going to have a lot
of issues or hurdles perhaps

transitioning over to that
virtual-led instructor training.

So, it's really important
that when you

are designing your
interactions and your

engagements in your virtual instructor
training, that you're able to

interact with
your participants

and collaborate with them and
make sure that they stay

engaged just like they
would if you were

in the classroom for an
instructor-led training.

Jeff: And that's a great
point Beth. This is

even more critical
when designing

the virtual engagement
and interaction

and collaboration tools. It's
so much more challenging

to figure out how to
do all this on the

front end rather than
just standing in

front of a classroom and
doing it as you go. So,

let's take a look and see some
of the most important things,

now. One of the things
that I wanted you to

really think about
is we talked about

this in webinar one, but I wanted
to just touch on it again briefly

because we've all been in these
training roles where we are

up against the the time crunch and
we have a supervisor that says

can't you just convert
that real fast to

virtual? You got it. Can you
just convert it real fast?

They think this
is we just wave a

magic wand and this
is how it happens.

So, what I'd like you
to do is take a

look at the time, specifically
the second one there, "Live

Instructor-Led (Virtual). ATD
did a survey with a number of

respondents and they took an
average of the hours to convert.

And so, one of the things that
you'll look at there is that

the average is 28 hours
it takes to convert

one hour of training.
So, check some

impressions. What are
you seeing here?

What are you thinking?
What about your agency?

Do you have enough time to convert
and do what you need to do?

Think about a 30 or 40 hour
instructor-led program

and how many hours that might
take you to convert virtually.

We just have a tendency to
underestimate the amount of time

it takes with design and
development for curriculum.

And the more interactive and engaging
activities that you design in,

the longer it takes
to put those in, the

longer it takes to
ensure that you have the

appropriate amount of
groups and breakouts set up,

the amount of activities
of the amount

of debrief that you're
going to do, as well.

So, time is a big development
consideration when it comes to the

conversion of your curriculum.
You have to make sure

that you're planning
for the time for

resources,
technical support,

producers. You
heard Leslie mention

that we have a producer
team with us today.

This thing can't happen without
the rehearsals that it takes.

So, there's a lot of
things that you have

to do when you're
factoring in virtual

than just someone waving a
magic wand and saying, "Yes,

convert this and let's move
on." So, make sure that we're

thinking about
this and that's why

we wanted just to
touch on this again.

Jim: Man, that's great
stuff, Jeff and Beth.

Thank you very much
for sharing that

and I see some
comments in the chat and

hopefully, this is
some things that you

folks can take back
to your leadership and

convince the folks in
your agency that it really does take

time, this analysis
phase and actually

designing and
converting things from

instructor-led to virtual
instructor-led.

Now, let's move and talk more about --
let's take a little deeper dive

and talk more about engagements and
interactions. So, what really are

engagements and interactions
in virtual training and...

Ashley: Jim, I have a question.
Why do we strive to achieve

collaboration and virtual...

Jim: Well, that's a great question,
Ashley, and thank you very

much for asking that. Really, both these
questions, what are

engagements and interactions
and why do we strive

to achieve collaboration
and virtual

training is really what we're
going to talk about. So, let's

take a quick look at that and what
we're going to first talk about. Ashley.

Ashley: Okay. So, first,
we want to consider

what is actual interaction?
Remember, we consider

interaction as a way
of providing the opportunity

for our learners to
communicate amongst

themselves with the facilitator and
through this technology, some of

these examples that we
can use to gain the

interaction is by
using chat,

emoticons, polls, two-way
audio, whiteboard,

the breakout rooms and some of
our platforms that they allow,

application sharing and
annotation tools and web browsing.

So, these are important
to realize that you can

increase that interaction
with your

learners in these
programs to help move forward

to keep them awake because,
remember, keep them

focused. We want their
participation. If we can

energize them and share that energy,
that's going to help them learn.

So, sometimes, having
those options

doesn't always guarantee
that deep learning

that we would like to
occur. So, Jim, interaction.

What about engagement
when it comes to these?

Jim: Thank you for asking that.
That's great stuff on

interaction, Ashley. Thank you
and, you know, I

encourage all of you folks
that are trainers out there,

been training for years
and you understand training. I mean,

that's what we want
in our classrooms, our

instructor-led classroom.
So, why wouldn't

we want that in our virtual
instructor-led

classrooms. That's how
learning takes place. That's how we

can ensure that folks
are actually going to take that

information, that new skill
that we're giving them and actually

apply it back on the
job. Really, as we

talk about engagement,
here, today, there

are really two types
of engagement we're

going to talk about.
The first one is

serial engagement. And,
serial engagement

is really when learners
that contribute

one at a time,
one after another.

Some examples of that
would be that if,

we as facilitators, ask
learners to state

their ideas, opinions
maybe one at a time,

and then let them
all speak one at a

time, maybe responding one at
a time to the facilitator.

Some of the things
we need to consider

when using serial
engagement during

our virtual instructor
led trains is

those exercises may
take a long time. So,

we may not have the
time to do that kind of thing.

It is orderly and
well controlled, so

some of us with control
issues, we may like that

a lot, but, also we need to keep in
mind that learners can sometimes

easily hide when we use
this type of engagement.

So, those are some
considerations with serial engagement.

Now, my favorite
type of engagement

when we use virtual
instructor-led

training is
concurrent engagement

and that is really
when activities that

engage all participants
at once and really

just like when we do our
instructor-led trainings in the

classroom, we can still
do that virtually we get

everybody involved at once.
Some examples is when we post a

whiteboard and learners
can write on the

whiteboard simultaneously.
Use those annotation tools,

breakout rooms
would assign this to

chart and breakout
rooms things like that.

And also some paired chat
maybe just some examples

of things we can do
and if we can get

those learners involved just
as you folks know, as trainers,

same thing applies
in the virtual world.

They feel important.
They feel valued.

They feel like their
voices are heard. That's really,

really what we're
striving for. We've got

to continue that in our virtual
classrooms just like we do

in our real world
live classroom, the

real world, but the live
in person classrooms.

So, now, for
example, what types of,

and I want to get
some chat going

because I'm going to get
you folks involved here.

What types of engagements
have we been using so far

in this webinar? Somebody
chat some stuff

in there, if you
would, please, folks.

Get some chat going.
Let me know that

you're you're actually paying
attention and listening to me.

What have we used to
engage you folks today?

Chat. Absolutely and thank you,
Tracy. I appreciate that, Christina.

Ah, Christina is
actually saying that

what they do in their training,
they set up a jeopardy game.

Brainstorming. Yeah, that's
what we're using today

and that's really all
we can do today, as

Leslie mentioned 
to you earlier,

this isn't the
training because we

got so many folks
on. I see

over 250 folks now,
here. We just can't

have all those other
engagements today. This is a

listen-only webinar,
concurrent

engagement, right now.
You're absolutely

right. Thank you, Robert.
I appreciate that.

That's exactly what
 we're doing.

So, that's engagement. I
appreciate you folks

posting things in the
chat. Good stuff. So,

Ashley, what about collaboration?
What do you think about that?

Ashley: A couple. 
I love collaboration. So,

things to think about
when we talk about

adding the interactive
engagement

and equaling that
collaboration through

those interactions, the
outcome we're looking for,

we want genuine
participation in this.

People get practice, hands-on
abilities through

collaboration, gives them a higher
order of

thinking, putting that in
action, deliberately

designing opportunities
for them to learn,

putting them in that
position, taking

them out of their comfort zones. And
then, it also leads to that deep

learning that happens during
putting that wheel to work.

So, these are just awesome ways of
ending up with that collaboration.

It allows them to build that
baseline of information

whether it be through readings,
chats, the breakout sessions,

offline activities and etc.

So, now, it's time to 
hear from you guys and gals. Based

upon your platform
that your organization uses,

okay, we want to know,
chat to all of us

the interactions and
engagements both the serial

and the concurrent
that you would like

to design or add to 
your virtual training.

Jim: That's good stuff. 
Yeah. Absolutely, Ashley. Thank

you for asking that question and
I already saw some stuff.

Some folks were talking
about doing a jeopardy game

and things like that
and I see folks are using

Zoom and Teams, offline,
con, life size, Zoom, yeah.

Ashley: Whiteboard breakout
sessions. These are great.

Jim: Great ideas and 
I think Leslie said

earlier, as well, I believe
the chat is going to be

and, correct me if I'm
wrong, Leslie, but

the chat will be sent
out so folks can

see what people
are posting in, as

well. So, maybe, you
can use this later

and maybe ask questions
of folks, what if

you don't understand what
some of those things are?

Leslie: That is correct, Jim,
and, in fact, a little

bit earlier in the session,
Scott from Colorado

had posted what a jamboard is. So,
I know Scott is on here, if he

would repost that because see
what's interesting about chat

is you only see the
chat after you join

the session. So, if 
anybody joined

really early, like
we had about 20 or 30

participants join,
you'll only see the chat

after you join the session. So, that's
just something for you to know,

as a designer and facilitator
as you're converting

your instructor-
led to virtual

instructor-led. That's
the way chat works,

but, yes, I'll be sending the
edited chat logs.

So, that we can continue to
actually share resources.

Jim: Super. Thank you, Leslie.
That's some great

chat and I really appreciate
all your interaction and

thank you, Ashley, for
getting them going.

So, what's next, 
Archie and Leslie?

Archie: So, that's really
cool. Now, we have to

figure out how we 
can match our

interactions and our
engagements to our

performance objectives. So, we
talked about this webinar, too, but

those performance
objectives drive

everything. So, how
can we use those in

interactions and
engagements to our

performance objectives in order
to achieve that collaboration

in our virtual training? So, let's
use design flow as our tool, here.

Leslie: Oh, all right, Archie. I agree
with you. Design flow

is a great tool. So,
to begin to match

your lesson designs
or your lesson plans

to your performance objectives
and the content taught

and then determine what interactions,
engagements and collaborations

you should design and
create. We can take our lead

from design flow professionals. So,
in this case, as you see up on the

screen, we start
at the left here

in red with our performance
objectives. Notice this is not

all of a module all at once.
It's performance objective by

performance objective. So,
if you're a curriculum

designer and developer
out there with me,

that's where you start. If
you're not necessarily

a curriculum designer, developer, but
you want to know how to do this

in a really solid,
orderly fashion to,

you know, with checks and
balances use this design flow. So,

you start at the left 
with your

performance objective, then
you delineate the contact

content that you need to teach
driven by that performance objective.

And then, you begin to determine,
you'll see in light blue,

the interactions, the engagements,
both serial and concurrent, and

designing in
collaborations within

our virtual training classroom
sessions. So, let's take a look

at a sample of how this
works. So, back in webinar two,

we took a look at the
overarching kind of session

for NIC's correctional
leadership development,

the virtual session. And
this is just a breakdown

of one of our two
performance objectives

for VILT session one.
So, starting over there

in red-y pink, you'll see
our performance objective,

which is following
guidelines for Action

Learning Project 
team report out.

ALP teams will deliver a
brief out with concluding

question and answer.
Then in green,

is actually the content
that we taught.

We taught some of it
back in phase one

of correctional leadership
development because this is

phase two VILT session
one. And then, we also had

intercession assignments on that
and then the ALP team

presentation guidelines. We first
talked in back in phase one

and then we reiterated during
the intercession period.

Then, you see up in
light blue, our various

interactions that we
designed. And notice

it's not just 
one interaction,

it is multiple. and thank you
Archie and you'll note that

some of the interactions
occur offline

before we ever get to
the VILT session one.

And some of them actually occur
during the live ALP session, yeah.

Action Learning Project teams
or Action Learning Projects.

So, what's cool about them is that
is a research-based evidence

practice in any kind of
training, but particularly

in supervisory management
or leadership development

for having real 
agency practice

from what you teach
in the classroom,

what they're learning about
themselves as individuals as

teams and then applying
it to a real agency

issue. So, I encourage
you to go out online

and look at Action
Learning Project research.

We have senior level and
executive sponsors of the teams

and we call them
ALPs for short, ALPs.

And then we use all
the tools of the

virtual instructor-led
platform that we have.

We use annotation tools, webcams,
chats, participant tools

so we can see the teams in
action in a socially-distanced

fashion and that's how
they do their report out.

Not only to us, but everybody else.
So then, in purple you see the

engagements that 
we designed.

The ALP teams are
collaborating offline

on preparing their ALP slide
deck for presentation

in that first VILT
following those

guidelines and they also get coaching
from us and feedback from us,

as their NIC coaches.
They were also getting

feedback because we
just did this first

session yesterday, so this
is hot off the press.

They were also getting coaching
from their own agency sponsors

and executive leadership
on their presentations.

And then, lastly, how we achieved
and reached collaboration.

Each ALP team debriefs their
presentation post-VILT one. That was

one of their
intercession assignments.

They debrief it from
an individual and a

team level and then we're going
to actually do a live debrief

at the beginning of VILT Two, which
is tomorrow and we're going to

summarize all the learnings
across ALP teams

in VILT Eight. And then, ultimately,
as an individual learner,

they're going to
add learnings

to their own leadership
development plan in practice

throughout the VILT series and
during intercession periods for

ultimate application on the job.
So, that is actually how to go

about that. So, Archie, where
are we gonna go next with this?

I think maybe we should
do one of these design

flows together with everybody
on the webinar. Whatcha think?

Archie: I was just about 
to say that. Let's rock.

Leslie: All right.

Archie: I'll go ahead and do this 
and let's do this using

chat. How about that? All right. So, what
we have on the left

side is our performance objective
and, again, I was stressing

our performance objective
is what drives our

activities in regards to
interaction and engagement, right?

So our performance objective
is following the procedure

presented in class. We're
going to locate and download

annual leave forms for agency
website. So, this is our

scenario that we're
going to work with.

What we're going to do is
we're going to take a look at

what content must be
taught in order to

achieve that
performance objective.

Also, what interactions
are needed in

order to achieve that performance
objective and that's being taught

in our virtual training?
session. Also, what engagements

are needed for us to achieve
that performance objectives?

And then, finally, what
collaboration must we

actually create in order to achieve
that performance objective?

So, we're going to go ahead and we're
going to start by chatting out

on the content. So,
again, our performance

objective is to
locate and download

annual leave forms from agency
website. So, if you were to train that,

what would be some
ways that we can

get that? So, we're going
to go in our green

box. What content must we
train on in order to perform

or to meet that
performance objectives?

Go ahead and shout
out to everyone

and we're going to
use Leslie to

annotate right on that
big old green box

there in the middle
for content. So,

we got some chats
coming in it looks like.

Let me just go back
up. Let me scroll back

up so system navigation.
So, Leslie, you

caught that one, it
looks like. What other

forms look like and have
them show the agency

how to use it so it looks
like kind of doing a

demonstration on how 
to access

and locate the 
agency website.

Leslie: What else are 
you seeing, Arch?

Archie: I am seeing it seems along the
lines of having a

slide deck that shows this,
how to access the website,

where the forms are, where to
download on your computer. That

is another piece of content
that we'll want to train on,

how to access and download
onto your computer

Leslie: What else you seeing, Arch?

Archie: You're seeing 
how to, looks like sign into the

system. It's a piece that 
may need to be touched on and I'm

scrolling. Thank you so
much for all these chats.

I know how to fill out
the form. Links

to the form and how
to fill those out.

And then, Leslie, when
you get a chance if

you could just click
on the screen so

those words will
appear for everyone.

Leslie: And I have 
done that.  All right perfect.

Archie: There we go. 
Perfect. So, it looks like we

have the content of what 
we're going to come

up and I'm pretty sure there's
other ideas all in

the chat. I apologize. I could
not get to all of them,

but what we're going
to do now is move

up to that light blue box on
the top right of your screen.

This is where we have
our interactions.

What should we design
in order to achieve

our performance objective of getting
them to locate and download

those forms. So, go
ahead and put that in

the chat to 
all participants.

And, Archie, maybe
we should just

remind everybody of the definition
of interaction

and I'm gonna do that 
and remember

interaction is providing 
learners the opportunity

to communicate 
amongst themselves,

the facilitators and
through technology,

chat, emoticon, polls,
two-way audio,

whiteboards, breakout
rooms, application

sharing, application
tools and web browsing.

Go for it, Archie, 
what kind of engagement

should we do?

Archie: Here's what we have 
coming in.

Thank you so much for that tip. So, 
it looks like a quick

help guide as a as a response 
that's coming in, flow charts,

a narrated PowerPoint
that one can view,

but let's look at
some other system.

A click on continue button or
click to see next button.

The ability to share their
screen and navigate the location.

We have some suggestions in
regards to demos or polls.

And then, annotations 
to share.

And I think some
people are just saying,

you know, just kind of knowing
the difference of what your

platform is, so all these
things will change, but these

are just the basic
ideas and also

using the whiteboard breakout
rooms and that kind of leads into

my next question. So,
if we go to that

middle box, 
that purple box there,

what engagement
should we design in

order to achieve this
performance objective?

So, what ways can we use
to design some engagement

to get that performance objective?
Go ahead and chat that out

to all participants
or to to everyone.

Leslie: And, remember, you can
design in serial

or concurrent engagements?
And that's where

all participants are
participating and engaging,

interacting all at
once at the same time.

Archie: So, we have
small group discussions

is one suggested.

Leslie: And how would 
we do that? Would

that be in 
the large room?

Archie: Someone said breakout
room.

Leslie: Mm-hmm.

Leslie: I think this might be a
cool one to do a paired chat too.

Archie: So, that was another 
suggestion. Thank you, Melissa.

We have chat and discussions 
that can go on. We can do

the simulation and breakout 
groups. So, chat, paired chat, discussions.

And we have a quiz that could
be done is another suggestion.

Thank you everybody for
your participation in this.

Raise hands to ask 
questions. So, yeah, we

can use games or just 
raise your hand and

ask questions in a way to
find engagement and get

those performance 
objectives achieved.

Archie: Great. Great.

Leslie: Mm-hmm.

Archie: And, Leslie, 
that's a great

tip. Thank you for sharing 
that for everyone.

Perfect. So, now, if we
just go on to that

bottom box, that turquoise
box there on the bottom.

We're trying to create
collaborations here

So, what should we
design in order to

achieve that
performance objective?

Go ahead and check that 
out to everyone.

And Ashley says 
she's stealing some of

these ideas. Hey, so am I,
Ashley. So am I.

Leslie: Me too. 
Me too.

Archie: So, again, how 
do we create that collaboration?

Ask for suggestions on how to
improve that process

going forward. So, it looks 
like...

...a little open-ended question 
to kind of figure out

what we can learn.

And then, Tracy shared on 
how to fill it out correctly.

Have them fill out correctly.

Scrolling down. Role play is another 
suggestion that could

come up in here or 
group practice.

Just kind of like we're 
doing now someone said.

Have that group exchange or 
let them actually annotate the steps.

Take a survey.

Or Anita shared about a group 
presentation via PowerPoint.

That sounds 
really cool.

Leslie, I know there's 
more ideas that are coming

in, but I know we 
want to kind of keep this going

because I feel really good
right now. How are you feeling?

Leslie: I think we've got
some fantastic ideas,

Archie, and definitely
this is proof

that together we are better. Synergy
works. So, thank you everyone

for doing this. So,
this is an example

just to give you this
particular technique of where

the facilitator
annotates based upon

what their training
group gives them and

notice, Archie was facilitating
and I was actually

annotating, but you can also do
this in the virtual instructor-led

classroom and the people who
would be annotating would be

all of the participants
all at once.

The key to making that work
though is really clear directions

on where you want them to
annotate on the screen.

So, in addition to all of
these fantastic ideas

that we've got up here,
we have a completed

form here for you to take a
look at and for us to peruse.

So, this completed 
design flow

is using that same
performance objective

that you have right
there in this

example that we just
worked on together.

So, Archie, what do we
want to do with this?

Archie Hey, team. I need y'all
to chat out what

are you noticing
about this design

flow? What are some
ahas or takeaways?

How do they compare
to what we came up

with as a large group
of over 260 people?

Or, you know, how is 
it different? So, go

ahead and chat 
that out to everyone.

[Leslie laughs]

Archie: All right. We have a
lot of this built in,

but it's getting
them to do it right.

Yes, I mean, we can
design engagement, but

if they don't do it,
what are we missing?

So, we want to really be there
and kind of separate those

interactions from engagements.

Leslie: Yeah, and, you know, 
it could be what

you're experiencing
is learner comfort

and feeling safe in the
virtual environment.

I know that that's
something we spend

time on in our virtual
instructor-led courses.

Pretty much, the first
half of our first VILT session

a couple of recommended
practices is just

orientation to the
platform, getting them

used to the tools so they feel
comfort and they get some mastery on

just the tools of the platform,
much less the content that you're

actually teaching. The other
thing that we have done here

at NIC very successfully is we
have what we call a "Separate

Orientation and
Tech Check VILT,"

and it's all about
making sure all of

their technology works and they
can access what they need to do

and then all the different
functionality that we use

during any and all
of the VILT sessions

will be checked out
before we ever get

to a VILT session where
we want to do content.

So, yeah,
don't forget that

orientation to the
tools and practice,

for sure. And that
is, again, another

just best practice
in general about

distance learning
regardless of the format,

whether it's video
conferencing, webinars,

virtual instructor-led
training or a blend.

So, just something
to know about. So,

Archie, what are you
seeing in terms of

themes there?

Archie: I've seen one 
thing I just wanted

to point out so I think Lorraine
Washington

talked about
what a gallery crawl is

and I just want to
share just briefly

what that means. And so,
let's say you brought

your groups into small
breakout groups.

They could be working
on a different

project, maybe different
topics similar

to the discussion
that's being had.

They can annotate their
different discussion

items as a group
and a host can actually save

those documents
depending on your

online platform
that you're using?

They can save that
and then post it in

the large group and 
you can give

one to three, four minutes
or whatever for everyone

to review what the
other groups worked

on. So, it's like kind
of being an art

gallery. You get to
see the fine art

that has been handcrafted and
made for your pleasure.

So, that's an idea of what a
gallery crawl would look like.

Leslie: Yeah and it's almost 
the same as if you were

in person, you know, 
how sometimes you get

them to walk and talk and look
at charted items

from small group
breakouts as a way and

then you do a 
summary debrief.

That's the virtual version of
it. It's a really cool technique,

for sure.

Archie: it is
really. Yes, it is really cool.

Leslie: It really is and we're
seeing so many fantastic

comments. And, yeah, thank you
for the compliment, Vicky.

Vicky is saying that my
readiness emails are

templates
for us to use. Yeah,

that's all about
getting you ready for

what's coming up and
being right ready to go.

So, it's effective
from the get go.

So, now, I'm sure you might 
be asking both me

and Archie, "Hey, you guys. What are
some

engagement tools that 
maybe I haven't

thought of yet? Help me 
out here."

Archie: Hey, let's take a look there 
are a whole

array of free online tools 
that you can use to

prepare for your virtual interactions
and engagement

for virtual training and I'm
just going to highlight

a few. I'm going to just
put my attention over

to the kind of this
this right little

corner of this thought
bubble here and

bring your attention
to just three items

that are on here, but
there's a lot more.

And if you have more
for engagement and

interaction, feel
free to chat out to

everyone what
things you may be using, but

Mentimeter,
Sli.do, Kahoot!, maybe? I

know I saw in the chat, we
talked about Kahoot! before, but

these are ways to engage people
in real time. You can do polls,

questions, quizzes, games
right there with it

as an add-on or supplement
to your already completed

online platform.
So, Zoom, WebEx, you know,

Microsoft Teams, whatever
you're using, you can use these

as an addition to
kind of finding those

engagements um and have a lot of
fun doing it, too,

quite honestly. There's 
other things that are

on here, too, so thank you
SessionLab for

these ideas, but feel
free to look up any of these.

But, really, when we're talking about
engagement, here's

just a few, small, few
examples of how you

can find some engagement
and interaction

in your online sessions
or offline sessions, as well.

Let's see, I'm not seeing any
others come to chat,

but I don't want you
to forget about the

ingredients to your
digital blend So, we

talked about this in 
webinar two.

So, that the ingredients
for your digital blend,

remember from webinar
two, we talked about

the second best
practice and that's

the digital blend between
your online live sessions

with your content
activities and your

offline assignments
and activities.

It's that digital blending 
equation that we

want to take a look at 
with 'A:' the length of

the duration or the length 
of your session,

'B:' the number of live 
sessions that are actually needed because of,

'C:' like, I talked about before, 
our virtual performance

objectives are driving us to this 
so that's what drives us.

So, remember, what we 
learned in webinar two, best

practices one and two come into
play before we do

implementation before
we implement. And that's

best practice three,
what's our duration and

our length? How many
sessions? How many

breaks do we need in order
for this to be a worthwhile

experience? Remember, 
interactions and

engagements, as
we've seen, can occur

both online or offline during
your assignments or activities,

which are all connected
back to our part

to our performance 
objectives. So,

our performance
objectives really help us match

what content and activities are
needed for our online sessions

and for our offline sessions
in those activities,

which include that
design flow for our

interactions and engagements
to achieve

collaboration and training. 
So, we've visited

analysis, we've talked about
the double Ds in regards to

design and develop on
this ADDIE road trip,

but, team, I need you to
do one thing for me,

we just covered a lot
of information. If

you can go ahead I
know you can't do

this, put your hands
in or give me a high

five. So, go ahead and
shout out to everyone,

chat out of five for
me. Give yourself a

high five, team, because we covered
a lot with that activity

on putting that all together.
There we go! And, again,

not deep learning, but
a way to have some

interaction there, Leslie.
So, let's go over to Jeff

and Beth and let's
talk about

there is no 'I' in team, but there
is an 'I' in Implementation.

Jeff: A lot of information 
packed in there,

Archie. Thank you and this 
is amazing

and this is what we're
talking about when we talk

about implementing this.
You're seeing it live,

here. This is
what you do with the chat.

So, just like Archie
said, hey, just chat

me a five and it's just a way
to implement some of these

short, little, quick
snippets to make sure

people are paying attention, but as
we arrive at virtual interaction

and engagement, we're now
at implementation. So, some

considerations to 
share with you...

in addition to the best practices
that we learned in webinar two,

there are some key
differences between

in-person and virtual
training to take into account.

So, Beth, what do you
see in here?

Beth: I'm sorry I was chatting
away on mute.

So, that's
really a good segue into

what are some of
the key differences.

The increased
role of technology

can be our friend
or it can be our foe.

I've been monitoring
the chat, just kind

of watching what you
guys are saying and,

you know, some agencies have
a lot of firewalls that

you have to break
through to be able to

utilize any of the
technology that

Archie was talking about or 
any of the interactive

tools. And I also saw a couple 
people in the chat mention

the fact that you know getting your agency
administration on board

with allowing these tools to be
incorporated into your training

can sometimes be challenging, but,
ultimately, the reward is you make

your training much more
meaningful and much more engaging.

We
have to think about

different strategies that
we use to engage our

learners. You know, when we're on
a webinar with 250 plus people,

it's very difficult for us to
read body language. We can't

because we can't see
you. So, we can't

really tell get a feel if
we're on track or we're not

on track unless we're keeping
you engaged in the chat

or perhaps we're
soliciting feedback. You

know, are we going too fast,
are we going too slow?

I know Leslie's
really good about

monitoring that and
watching our time

and that can be
challenging sometimes from

a presenter's
standpoint when you are

in front of a classroom
in a virtual environment.

Oftentimes, you know, if
you require your staff

to have their 
cameras on. You can

somewhat tell what
they're doing, but not

always. So, again, it just goes
back to that engagement

and the the absolute importance
of keeping people engaged.

I also want to talk about
the necessity of multitasking.

When you are running
a virtual-led

instructor training,
and I noticed a chat,

a comment in the chat from
Leslie Bestly. She said that

she was drained after
running a VILT

case manager training
yesterday. And I

can really empathize
with that because

we have so many things
going on behind

the scenes when we're
doing a virtual training.

You know, you have technology
hurdles that sometimes

we can't overcome, but that's why
we have four or five people

in a webinar this size
producing on the back end.

And I talked to
some of the producers

after the training and say,
you know, "How busy were you?"

And they were extremely
busy just troubleshooting

for the participants.
So, we can make this

the absolute best experience
for you.

The other issue is, as a facilitator, we
sometimes forget

to engage our audience because
we have to focus on the time.

You have to focus on the
content. What's coming up next?

You know, is your
co-facilitator on

mute and you have to 
pick up the slack for

them because I was talking
to myself not all of you.

And, Jeff, you did a
fantastic job. So,

you know, working together as a
team, but also understanding that,

as a facilitator, if you have the
fortunate opportunity to have

at least a co-facilitator
and at least one

producer things are going
to run much more smoothly

for you as opposed to
being in the classroom

just having one person standing
in front doing the presenting.

Beth: All right. So, 
Jeff and Ashley.

Jeff: Yeah, thank you so much,
Beth. So, one of

the things we're thinking about
here is we're talking about

the virtual facilitator
skill sets. That

first one there about the
ability to multitask.

Think about your
role, as Beth just

talked about, and how many
things you have to do.

Even in this webinar,
which we have a lot

of different people 
helping out,

I'm multitasking behind the scenes.
Not only am I watching the chat,

I'm checking the
slides, I'm seeing when

in the notes section 
what's next,

I'm watching also my
cell phone because,

as producers and facilitators, we'll
do a little text group where we

keep in touch with each
other that way. So, if we're

on track or off track,
we can actually

hit each other on a
different platform.

And so, we're not just totally
focused on the chat to produce

and to facilitate.
So, there's a lot of

different things you can
do as a facilitator,

but you have to get
comfortable with

this and I and I can't say this
enough, but even when you're

multitasking, 
rehearsal is key.

Ashley: Okay, next we're going to
talk about the master

the technology and this
can be more challenging,

like we talked about 
having that

facilitator learn the
virtual classroom,

teaching that live online
session the instructor needs to be

comfortable in what
they are using,

how they are using it and that
when it comes to that platform,

using the features, if they're
familiar with those to be able to

enhance that online session
with their learners.

They also need to be able
to switch among presenting

to a whiteboard, answering
those chat messages,

interacting with 
those learners.

That's also definitely part 
of mastering that technology

that helps lead you into that
multitasking like Jeff just talked about.

Jeff: And I'm moving into creating 
a comfortable learning

environment. This is
something that you have to do.

In corrections, we
have a broad array of

different age groups,
different skill sets.

Some people are very, very computer
savvy and

technologically-driven, some people are not.
So, as a facilitator,

you have to create that
learning environment for them.

You have to make sure that
you can walk them to this

and you can say it's okay. 
It's okay that you may not know

something. You raise your
hand in the platform, you

ask the question in face-to-
face, we do this all the time,

but we sometimes
forget to do this when

we're sitting behind 
the screen.

So, we have to make sure that even
though the demand

is different, the skills are equally
important and

we have to make sure
that people can

be comfortable in this so that
the learning transfer occurs.

Ashley: Okay, next, it's super
important that I

had difficulty with when
we switched to the VILT,

was building that rapport
that was one thing that I

absolutely loved with my
students was that connection.

And building that connection,
being able to develop that bond

to get to know their
first name, their

last name, little things
about their personal life.

It's harder because we can't
see them, we can't hear them

and building
that rapport makes

people feel like
they're a real person.

And so, with engaging our learners
the way that we do through VILT,

they can ask those questions,
participate in discussions

and help create that
frequent engagement,

whether it be with polling 
questions or asking

them to respond and chat or 
unmute their mic, use that

white board that we talked
about and contribute to that

discussion or help create a list of things
that we need to work on.

So, next, and...

Leslie: And if I could... Yeah, thank 
you, Ashley,

if I  could just add one quick 
thing and I asked

this question in chat and I think it's
really

important because 
something I hear a lot

from folks is so how
can I build rapport

in either a webinar 
or a VILT?

Think about what we've
done today just

in the webinar format to attempt
to build rapport for you.

What are some of the things
that you can transfer

over from techniques and strategies
that work when you're in person

that will also work for
the VILT or the

virtual instructor-led
classroom? There

are some things we've done today
very specifically to do that.

One of the things
we've done and I

just want to pause on that one
because I think that's a big one in

terms of that and the
technology and making myself

and learners comfortable,
how do you build rapport?

And you guys see what comes
up in chat, Jeff and Ashley.

What are you guys
seeing in chat and

answer in response to
that question I'm posing?

Ashley: Calling on specific
people by name. I use that

with my class roster ahead of
time what facility they're at

and referring to them by
their first name. Yeah, absolutely.

Leslie: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Jeff: And webcams is a big
one and, you know, honestly,

we turn our webcams
on to introduce

ourselves and then
we shut them off

because we have so
many connections. It

really drags our
bandwidth down and we

figured out that
that really kills

our audio here, but when we're
in small build sessions of 30

or less, we're going
to have our webcams

on all the time. So,
that's a great point.

Another thing that I was
thinking about is pre-activities.

So, when you're setting
up a bill, you can

do pre-activities and emails
and getting to know you,

especially if you don't
know people. Share bios,

favorite things,
struggles, things like

that. So, there's a
lot of different

pre-activities that
you can do to build

that rapport before
you even start.

Leslie: Thank you and sorry,
Ashley, I

interrupted you and Jeff, and
you were right at be a teacher.

Jeff: Thank you and the last
one would be a teacher.

Think about that. You
have an opportunity

to ensure that this
learning transfer

occurs, 
and you have to, not only

present and facilitate
and lecture, but

you have to be the teacher. So, in a
sense, I kind of think of this as

hand holding and
you're going to walk

them to it. You're
going to make sure

that what you
normally would do in

person, you're going
to make sure you're

keeping aware as a virtual
instructor and a virtual teacher

and you're going to
keep that session

flowing. You're going to make
sure that you're being engaging

and responding to those
chats asking for

questions along the way,
making sure that you

are giving time,
taking a pause,

allowing people to get
a drink and to just

soak in some of the
things that were

going on. And so,
think about that as

you're also being a producer
as you're being a facilitator.

You're also a teacher.
So, think about

that when you're
trying to make sure that you are

being intentional with
your engagement activities.

Ashley: Something also to consider is
practice and being authentic.

Let's face it, folks. I know as
well as anybody else, Murphy's Law.

if it can go wrong,
it will go wrong. So,

practicing those five skills,
preparing ahead of time helps build

that being able to be comfortable,
improve the multitasking feel,

skills, as well. Through
that experience, I

suggested earlier
having a little IT

bag of tricks that you know
about that has worked for you,

suggesting those to
your learners, if

possible. Have a
planning session and be

interactive always in
that virtual classroom,

creating those polls
ahead of time,

having those questions prepared
that way you don't have to come

off the top of your
head with them. Those

are just some of 
the suggestions.

Write a script, edit
the script as you go,

if something's working,
not working for you

and master the content
of that script.

So, that's just our
final bit of advice

when it comes to the essential
virtual facilitator skills.

Beth: All right, thanks,
Ashley and Jeff and

I just I really want to
say one thing. I've been

sitting here listening to
what you're saying and I go back

to thinking
about a training that

I co-facilitated with Jim
Wiseman, who is on this

training session with
us as one of the facilitators,

and, you know, not only
is it important to

develop the rapport with your
participants, but your co-facilitators.

You must practice. I
know we've said that

a hundred times 
at least and

hopefully we'll say it
a hundred times more

before this is over. In order
for this to be successful,

you really have to be comfortable
with your co-facilitators

and have that
rapport with them.

Egos really need to go
out the window because

if you have ego, if
you are in a power

struggle with your co-facilitator,
potentially that information

or that observation can come
out in the evaluation process.

So, again, I'm going
to pick on Leslie Bexley.

She made a comment about the
importance of evaluation.

This process in this
way that that we

are presenting training
and creating training

is new for for
virtually everyone.

And we are continuing
to improve

content, improve delivery and
improve the way that we do things.

And as facilitators
and as producers,

you know, we really
need to be open

to the feedback. So, I'd like
for you to just take a second

and give us some examples of how
you use evaluation as a part of

virtual-led instructor 
training.

And while you're
typing that, I can just say

whenever National Institute of
Corrections puts on any kind of VILT,

not only do the producers
and the facilitators

practice, practice, practice,
we also will stay online

and we will do a debrief
after everyone has gone.

What did we do well? What feedback
did we receive in the chat?

Did anybody receive
text messages or

emails indicating any
issues that we had?

And we're keeping notes on that
so next time it can be better.

So, some of the things
that I'm seeing is

an email asking for feedback,
a survey before and after the

training. Yes, absolutely. Asking
your co-workers to observe a

run-through, which, you know, essentially,
could be a pilot and

give you honest 
feedback,

sending out SurveyMonkey. You
know, sometimes people don't

want to be honest because
especially if they're going to

have any kind of constructive
feedback or constructive criticism,

but, you know, if you
have that rapport

that you've created with your
participants and your co-facilitators

and your producers. It's hopeful
that you will have an open,

honest environment and be
able to take that feedback

and that all
of those different

evaluation methods and
continue to improve

your training.
Interesting that Reshma says I

created and generated
a survey to gain

insight into learning
preferences. That's

awesome. I've
not thought of that.

Jeff, do you have 
anything to add?

Jeff: I would just say that
thinking about evaluation,

what did you design
in? Did you design in

points to be evaluated
through teach back,

designing aha moments
or just even at

the end of the lesson
asking what was the most

important thing you
took away from this?

What was the one thing
you learned today

that you're going to implement and
things like that. So, what you're

doing is you're allowing them
to say this is what I learned

and you're being able to then
kind of continue to evaluate

were you able to get
the point across

that you designed in
that you intended to

develop and make sure
that you put into play.

Leslie: Fantastic ideas and
I want to share one

and I know John 
Eggers and Jim

are here on the line. I
believe almost my whole CLD

team is on the line.
Something that we're doing

is as a part of the
beginning of each VILT

session after the first one, I'm
going to be doing what we call a

review preview, which is a
what bubbled up for you.

And we're going to ask
specifically for feedback

on how the virtual
instructor-led

training environment
is working for them.

So, we just, you know,
we're not gonna

keep, you know, not
address the elephant

in the room we're going
to get live real-time

feedback
after people have had

just a little bit 
of soak time.

And, again, our sessions are
every Tuesday and Thursday.

So, they won't lose
what they thought, but

sometimes your reflective learners
need just a little bit of time

to answer that
question with some

really solid 
information for us.

So, I think we're almost
ready to pull this

all together here and
just a heads up,

question and answers are
coming up shortly for everyone.

Just wanted to give
you that heads up

if you haven't already posted
your questions to us.

So, here's our road trip
and where we visited

with lots of considerations
all along the way,

not only in this webinar, but in our
other webinars.

So to 
summarize...

Ashley: First, we start off
with that analysis. Oh,

that analysis. We
talked about the tools

that we're designing to
support our agency's platform,

that we need to use, taking
that instructor-led curriculum

and converting it. We talked
about how much time that takes.

So, once that analysis is completed,
our next stop was design

Archie: And then moving on up on
down that ADDIE road trip,

we have
design where we're

talking about the interactions
and engagements, like

what are we going to
do in order to kind

of achieve those collaborations
and how are they supported

by the platform that
our agency is using?

So, getting familiar
with that knowing

what that is because we definitely
want to have those interactions,

those engagements really
drive what's our next piece.

Those performance
objectives.

I promise you, I'm
gonna get that word

out. I love performance
objectives, but I

cannot get it out. 
I'm so excited,

but that's what
drives us, right? So, we

got those engages and interactions,
right? So, is it going to be

serial, like, you know, a
killer or a podcast

or is it going to be
current, like a drug

charge? What are 
we doing there?

But, again, that's what drives us
is our performance objectives.

Let's keep on going
down to the development.

Jim: Thanks, Archie, and so
glad I'm following

you and after you
talked about design

and the great job that you did
in leading us through a design.

And so glad to hear
you talk about

performance objectives
drive and that's

how you develop the
lesson plan. So many

of the trainers
from the past or

maybe from the school
of hey, let's write

their lesson plan
and then go back and

put some objectives in
so glad to hear you

talk about the objectives
or what drives

the train. And you got
to make sure once

when you do the
development, now you got

to make sure that design flow matches
well with the objectives and

the content and all the
interactions and engagements.

You talked about and
you got to make

sure that those 
interactions and

engagements are going
to work for you

as you develop this in a
virtual instructor-led world.

So, that's development. Now, let's
talk about our implementation.

Beth: So, we've
analyzed, we've designed,

we've developed we've
gone down this curvy road

and now it's time to
implement. You have

heard I think all
of the facilitators

say five or six times and
multiple people in the chat,

practice, practice, practice.
It's really, really important

that when you are getting ready
to implement this training,

that you are practicing
and that you are also

building on your facilitator
strength and utilizing them

in the best capacity
that fits their

skill set in order for that
training to be the most successful.

So, once we have implemented, it's
now time for us to evaluate.

Jeff: Wait, what? We have to evaluate
our virtual training?

I've never heard of
this. So, yeah, I mean

think about this. if we're
not evaluating our training,

how are we going to
get that feedback

that we need to make
sure that we were

meeting our objectives?
What types of

strategies are you going
to use to measure

your virtual training, your
interactions, your engagements,

your collaborations deployed.
So, think about this

and when you design
this, think about

what you're going to evaluate and
so you can put your evaluation

throughout. that chat
should start early

and then make sure
that you're

putting it back into
that cycle and you're

questioning yourself along
the way. What am I evaluating?

Am I getting out
there in the job

site and evaluating? Am I
talking to some of the

trainers? Some of the
officers out there that are

training some of these
new folks after

the training, what
are they seeing?

So, different things
that you can do to

make sure that you're evaluating,
but don't forget the evaluation.

Again, as we've talked
about in some of

our previous webinars,
we often kind of

gloss over analysis
and evaluation, but

those are important.
Those are your

bookends, if you will. So
make sure that we're

not forgetting 
about evaluation.

Leslie: And with that, our 
road trip is complete

 in terms of designing and adding interaction
and engagement

and collaboration tools to our
virtual instructor-led training.

So, it is now time for you to
actually chat to us and so,

Jeff, Jim, and Ashley, what
do we want them to do here?

Jeff: Well, chat some ideas
with us. Let's

hear what are some of your
initial plans to

design and add in some interaction
and engagement activities?

Are you already doing it? Have you
never thought about it before?

Is it a challenge for
you based on what

you're able to 
do at your agency?

What will they not
allow? Things like

that. So, just give us some chats as
you're thinking about

designing and developing and
implementing and evaluating.

You heard us kind of
talk about it. What

are you thinking? How are
you going to do this?

And start chatting
some stuff in here.

Jim: Yeah, thank you, Jeff.

Beth: Sorry, Jim. People are coming
out with smaller class sizes.

More technical interaction.
Oh, chat's on fire.

There it goes. Sorry,
Jim, what do you see?

Jim: Oh, just this reading  what you
said, Ashley, and also, you know,

talking about, you know,
practice, practice, practice

with the new tools I really
like seeing that and, you know,

there were some questions 
before you even

asked that question, Jeff, and I'll throw
some of those out.

I want to make sure
we don't lose these

because I think it
was might have been

Katie earlier. They asked
the question about

how much lecture do we
recommend and,

you know, I think, you know,
there's different

schools of thought
on that, Katie and

whoever else might
be thinking that,

but, really, you
just can't lecture

more than one or
two slides without

having some kind of
interaction, some kind of

something to get them active
and engaged in doing things.

So, that's just my
thought on that. I

want to make sure we didn't
lose sight of that question.

Great stuff. What else you
seeing, Jeff, in the chat?

I saw a question
earlier and, again, it

just there's different
scenarios that

are going to play
out for everyone in

their agencies but they talked about,
you know, can you have your

participants have
control of the slides

so they can move the slides
instead of the instructor.

And there are different
platforms that

allow different things.
So, your platform

may allow you to engage that,
your platform may not. So, you'll

just have to see what
platforms you're using.

There's times where
we will turn it on

or we will turn it 
off depending

on the instruction that
we're doing or the scenario

if we're given group
activity, maybe they

want to thumb back
through the slideshow

and take a look at
some other things. So,

there's opportunities
you have as a

trainer depending
on the different

platform that you're
using to engage

your participants in
different ways. And, again,

like we talked about,
really, you get

there with practice.
You'll set up

sessions where it's just you
and a couple other trainers.

And you'll get in
there and you'll play

around with them. 
So, I think that

the more you familiarize
yourself with the platforms,

the more effective 
you become.

Ashley: Sorry, also seeing the
interactions with the

three to five minutes and using
multiple trainers from different

aspects with different experiences
that helps people, as well.

So then, we have to
ask those other

questions that we
have. Leslie, go ahead.

Leslie: Yeah, yeah. Well, I saw
one early on and thank you,

Jeff, for addressing that and
it was that thing about,

do I allow my participants
to forward their own slides

or to save the slides
or save whatever I'm doing.

You know, you have to
think about what is

the outcomes? It all goes back
to performance objectives.

What outcomes are you looking
for that live online session?

Will it assist in
learners meeting

or exceeding the
performance objectives

by allowing them
controls of the slides

or would that take
away from that? So,

again, everything always goes back
to the performance objectives

in whatever engagements
and interactions

and collaborations 
you design,

as well as what kind
of settings you put

on any given session. It all
goes back to the outcome.

I know there's lots of questions
also about how do we get

leadership support,
not only around just

really committing to the use of
virtual platforms, but also that

whole thing about you know are
they going to support it, not only

with you know verbal
support, but be able to

support people with real
time dollars and staff

resource and even
technology build-outs.

What would you guys say to someone
seeking more information on that?

That was a 
question.

So, one resource for
that is webinar one.

We explicitly talked
about that.

I know several questions were about
how can I really convince them

of the time needed
to develop just one

hour of training. The American
Talent Development Association

is a fantastic
resource to you.

So, ATD, that is where
we get all of our best

practice information
from and then

they do that survey
on the time needed

to convert one hour
of training

depending or the time
needed to actually

develop one hour of training
and then you have to put

a little bit more time estimate
on there if you're converting.

So, what about the
whole idea of how

to get resource 
support, you know,

real leadership
commitment because I

saw several people
chatting about that

and asking that
question dies here

on the facilitation team. 
What do you need to

show your leadership
to get them to commit

time dollars and 
staff resources

to virtual instructor-led training
or any kind of virtual learning.

Beth: I think one one of the
issues or barriers

is if you have
leadership that does not

have any kind of
curriculum background or

training background.
One thing that I did

was I involved a 
supervisor that

I had who was a
warden at one point

in time and really 
had no idea

and really anything about training.
Great boss, wonderful person,

but I just sat down with
him and I went through

some of the research that
I had done and I also

weekly checked in with
him when I was creating

virtual-led instructor training
in transitioning over

some of our curriculum,
and basically

every week doing the
check-in with him,

saying okay this is
how far that I've

gotten, this is how
much time I worked.

And it was really about
an education process.

Leslie: Mm-hm. Yeah, because 
usually they're worried

about the bottom line on 
everything, including learning and

development that's going
on in your organization.

So, yeah, it's an education
process over time.

We, here at NIC, are a
living example of that,

as well. So, 
it's not just you

or how you're feeling that is shared,
not only in the public sector

and the government sectors, but
also in the private sector.

So, all of us learning
and development

professionals are in
the same boat when

it comes to that. 
That's a theme

that runs throughout ATD
research that I really recommend

you check out their
website and also ICTP.

I know that there's
going to be a

virtual conference coming
up later this year

and they actually will be addressing
some of those questions there

during that conference. We
typically do one or more sessions

during the ictp conferences 
so I know I've seen another

one here. It's a best 
practice

question. I've seen somebody 
saying, hey, should I do

15 days of training
in a row via VILT

and what is the sweet spot in terms
of number of hours of duration

for training sessions? So, I
would refer you, first of all,

back to webinar two and the
participant workbook

because we addressed that
in great detail there

and that idea of doing
both online and live

online content and activity
because it is not a one-to-one

correlation between we did
40 hours or 178 hours

of basic training. So, that
means I'm gonna do 178 hours

of online training. Actually, it
doesn't. You have to look at

how people learn, how
much information

and activities they can
take in one setting

in the virtual instructor-led
training environment.

That's why when you
go and look back

at webinar two, you'll see
three different examples

of how to do all virtual
instructor-led training

for me, myself, 
with correctional

leadership development and management
development for the future.

We're doing a dynamic blend of
multiple three-hour sessions with a

15-minute break at the
approximate midpoint.

We have pre-session work
leading into each session

and intercession offline assignments,
both team and individuals.

So, if there's a sweet spot,
it's somewhere between

three and four hours. Once you
hit that over four hour mark,

you've really lost participants
because that goes to

just human attention
spans and think

about all the things
you've said here

about how much more
intensity it takes for you.

Well, that's also true
for your participants.

So, what other questions
are you all seeing

in here. I know somebody
had asked earlier,

do we have a facilitator
guide for this webinar?

Yes, we do and it is written
at the handoff-level, meaning

there are cues for
each one of us

and then we put it in our
own words and paraphrase it.

So, just like you need
great curriculum

for in-person training
for it to go well,

you also need even more
paramount and critical

to have really detailed
curriculum for

virtual instructor-led
training. And

this is a webinar and we have
a detailed facilitator guide.

So, just wanted to you know
pull that curtain back again

and answer that
question. So, other

questions that we saw there.
Jeff, have you seen some others?

Jeff: Yes, there was one talking 
about how can we ensure that

we can maybe keep continuing to 
do virtual training even after

Covid and I think that's one of the
things that you have

to really kind of closely
evaluate. And,

so many times, we think that a
butt in the seat in the classroom

is actually learning,
but virtually

behind a computer, they're
not really engaged.

I would argue that I can
engage participants

better in an online
platform than I can

sometimes in a
traditional classroom. In

a traditional
classroom, sometimes

they'll sit there
and you're not sure

what they're doing, right,
because of the way that

the lecture is
prepared or things of

that nature, but when
I've got them in a

virtual classroom and
I've built in these

engagement activities 
and these

interactions, I'm not letting more
than two or three minutes go by

before I'm asking
someone to give me a

green check, give me a
smiley face emoticon,

chat me the number
five, like Archie said.

I'm gonna put you
in a breakout session.

I'm gonna have you do a teach
back. So, there's a lot more

opportunities I think
to engage and to

make sure that the learning
transfer is occurring.

So, again, it's how you design
it, it's how you present it

and it's how you sell
it and invite that

leadership to your training and
let them see that it's working.

Leslie: Mm-hm. And I know several
of you had asked

questions early on
because you're not

necessarily curriculum
designers. If you go to our

information center, there
is a self-directed version

of Effective Training 
Design and

Development. Now, 
I'll tell you

when we created that,
that was about

in-person training, but
there's lots of things

in there where we also talk
about blended training

in it, also. It
wouldn't actually

be all about
how you virtually

convert. There's so many resources
out there available for you,

but I do want to point that out
as a resource. And, hello, Brasson!

Yes, would it be an effective
approach to deliver teach backs

virtually? Archie, I'm going to let
you respond to that question

because you 
have done it.

Archie: Well, yes, it can 
be done, but I want to emphasize

one thing.
It was a combination of what

Ashley talked about
in regards to your

IT bag and what
Jeff talked about

in regards to kind of understanding
the platform that you're

in. Practice, practice,
practice and so the

reason why I say
this because you can

use webcams in order to kind
of get some of the skills

training work,
some of the soft skills

figure it out in a
virtual classroom, but

I can just tell you one of
our producers, Scott Richards,

we've worked 
together to just

understand what the
platform looks like for

all the different
types of ways that

people can come
in. So, for example,

some of you or most
of you probably came

in through a PC and
were able to connect

through a desktop app
and so when Leslie

said click on the little
chat bubble on the

bottom right corner you found it;
however, if you came into a browser

maybe it's in a
different spot. If you

have people coming
on our iPhone or

iPad or using some
ios type of platform,

it looks different.
So, when you're

practicing with your other
trainers to kind of get familiar

with these different
settings, really

try to log in from, 
like, you see

this person is juggling a
phone, a tablet and a laptop.

Figure out what it
might look like for

people coming in all
different types of ways

so that you can have it in
your IT bag. Now, I want to say

most of us 
in the panelist box, will

not profess that
they are some IT

guru, but with a lot
of practice, practice,

practice, you 
start to understand.

Exactly. but, Leslie,
you can navigate and

tell people where to 
go in WebEx

without even batting an eye and
that's just because of the practice,

practice, practice. So, all that stuff
can be done, but, again, I just

chalk it up
to practice, practice, practice

and making sure that
people have the capability

of being able to show their
faces on those cameras

for some of that work
to be done.

Leslie: Yeah. Thank you and 
so I wanna just let everybody

know that in chat, we're having a
great discussion

and sharing. Christine is sharing
how she chunks up

her training with breaks. I know
somebody's gonna ask can you do

physical self-defense skills
training virtually?

Please, do take a look at chat and
see what Ashley shared about that.

And our last question,
I want to point out

and it's a great
question and thank you

so much, Jeff Merino,
for asking it.

You guys seem to
have divided up this

material and subject matter
into 1.5 hour chunks.

Was this on purpose versus combining
into a longer three hour class

you just mentioned as
being best practice?

Well, Jeff, what you're
asking us to tease

apart here and it's
really important to note,

we are delivering a webinar, today.
In webinars, the best practice is

1 -1.5 hours for virtual instructor-led
training where you're able to do

so much more interactions and
engagements using breakouts

and each participant
annotating,

all kinds of things that we
can't do in the webinar format,

you can go a little
bit longer. You'll see

research out there saying
two to three to four

at the most is the best practice

for length of sessions
for virtual instructor-led

training. The best practice for
webinars is somewhere between

1 and 1.5
hours with tons

of engagement and interactions.
The most you can design in.

So, yes, it was very deliberate
on our part when we actually

initially designed and
conceptualized this webinar series.

We knew it would be three.
We knew each would be

1.5 hours in
duration and we knew exactly

what our performance objectives
were and our content were

for each session. So, yes, again,
overarching design, when you are

designing not only a series
of webinars, like we've done,

but an overarching design of your
virtual instructor-led training.

So, I believe we have
some resources here

best to share 
with everyone.

Beth: We do and what a nice segue. 
I'm monitoring the chat and

Ann Schafer ask is there a location 
where you can list the best

practices or share resources? So, ask
and you shall

receive. So we've listed
just a couple of the

resources. There are a
few of the resources

that you can utilize. There have
been a lot of questions about,

you know, how do we get
started or, you

know, how long should we last? You
know, based on topic, that can be

very different. You have a
lot of resources here with

the participants, the NIC staff,
your facilitator, but, also,

just going online and doing some
of your own research can really be

beneficial in getting your
virtual lead instructor training

up and running.

Leslie: Mm-hm. And I want to
let everybody know that in the

participant
workbook for webinar two

and several times uh the link
to reach that on our website,

has been posted
there is a complete

participant workbook
for that one,

including two pages of resource
links. So, please, do check out

that participant workbook for
session two. And just to know,

there will be a participant
handout coming for

this particular
 webinar.

And with that, we hope that,
now, each one of you is

now able to convert your
instructor-led training

to virtual instructor-
led

training using the
nuts and bolts

that we've shared across all
three of these webinars.

So, I want to give the floor
to Jeff for a final thank you.

Jeff, you're muted. Jeff there
you go. You're muted.

Jeff: You got two mute buttons you got
to play with, here. So,

just want to say thank
you to everyone

for attending. And
at NIC, we love

doing this, we love helping out
and assisting in any way we can.

One of the things
that I think was

really neat from this
three series webinar,

we learned a lot from each other
in the chat, and even today, I saw

participants sharing
curriculum with

each other and bouncing emails back
and forth and things like that.

And I just wanted to
say that we partner

with all the big 
organizations,

ACA, AJA, APPA and
that's how we get a

lot of information from you and
also provide information and we

do a lot of these things. There's
another organization that, like,

Jim Wiseman mentioned,
he was the past

President of ICTP and
if someone could

chat that address in, that
web address, would be great.

We partner with them frequently.
It is the only corrections

network for trainers,
specifically. So,

they bounce curriculum back and
forth with other trainers

and they find out, hey, this is how
best practices are utilized. So,

we present at IACTP's virtual 
conference last year and

this upcoming October, as
well. I encourage you

to hit that website.
You'll find a plethora of resources to

get in contact with
other trainers.

And, again, we partner
with all these

organizations to help
make sure that we

can get this information
into your hands.

We really
enjoyed the series. We

hope that you were able
to learn something.

You have all of our
contact information.

Please, don't hesitate
to reach out to us

and, Leslie, let me turn
it over to you.

Leslie: All right. Thank you, 
Jeff, and I want to

give a big shout out and thank 
you to Jeff, Ashley, Beth,

Jim and Archie, my co-facilitation 
partners in this series and

in many other projects  and a 
big thank you to our NIC

producer team who always 
performs flawlessly behind the scenes.

We have Evelyn Bush, Belinda
Stewart, Case Dent and Glenn

Watson. So, most of
all, most of all,

we want to thank all
of you for being

here and your 
full participation.

Just a couple of
reminders. As all

webinars in this series
are being recorded

and you're going to receive
notification from me

on when they are 
accessible on

the NIC website for
viewing and download.

Also, I know there were
questions in chat about

how we actually monitor and report
attendance and participation

in these webinars. What I will
do tomorrow morning is I'm

going to run an
attendance report

and then you will get a
verification email from me

that you participated.
Also, if you logged on

today's webinar, in
about 30 minutes or so,

you will get a thank you
for attending and in that

email from the messenger
at WebEx.com system,

will be also an email to document
and verify your attendance

right out of the 
WebEx system.

So, again, don't forget the
functionality of your platform

with what it can do for you in terms
of all those kind of questions.

I saw another question and we
always get this for webinars

about do I get a
certificate for this?

Well, you're not going to
get a certificate from

NIC on this because we did not
run this through our learning

management system, niclearn.com.
Since we have such big crowds for

webinars we actually
do the attendance

and registration
process directly

through WebEx. So, please, do check
your spam or junk folders

from emails from me as
well as from

messenger@webex.com.
Thank you all

for being here today.
Jeff has posted

February the 3rd through 6th,
which is starting, today, NIC

is having a virtual booth at ACA's
virtual conference. If you have

registered for that,
that is already

begun and sessions
have been running

since this morning,
eastern time. I know

I'm looking forward to attending
hopefully one or more sessions and

actually visiting the booth.
Thank you all for being here.

Stay safe, stay healthy. Get a
vaccination. Elizabeth says our

booth, virtually,
is in hall 4. We'll

see you at virtual
conferences coming up.

Stay in touch. Thank 
you, everyone.

This concludes
today's webinar.
